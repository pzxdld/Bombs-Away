# Bombs-Away
This is a Minesweeper clone I wrote in HTML / JavaScript when taking a JavaScript class in 2008 (where does the time go???). It's old and a little buggy. Maybe not buggy as much as some incorrect logic. Anyway, I thought I'd update it to learn how to use GitHub repositories.

I'm an engineer by education, semi-retired after a career in the auto industry. I developed a love for programming and web development during my career but it was never my "job". I took lots of community college classes, and now online training, in full-stack web design, application development, infosec, etc. I'm trying to play a lot of catch-up to be able to do work (even entry-level work) in these fields now.
