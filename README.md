# Bombs-Away
A Minesweeper clone I wrote in HTML / JavaScript when taking a JavaScript class. It's old and a little buggy.
I'm an engineer by education, semi-retired after a career in the auto industry. I developed a love for programming and web development during my career but it was never my "job". I'm trying to play a lot of catch-up to be able to do work (even entry-level work) in this field now.
